# bok-engine
game engine using LWJGL including phong lighting and skeletal animation  

steps to run:  
add code to eclipse ide or other ide  
remember to add res and src folders to build path  
add LWJGL3 with JOML jars, PNGDecoder jars and slickutil jars to project classpath  

the jars used work on windows 11. You may need to download other operating system  
jars from lwjgl website if not using windows  

if you create animations in blender for this game you have to set the max weights to 4 
and also remember to normalze all weights.
